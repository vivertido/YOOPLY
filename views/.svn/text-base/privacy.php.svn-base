									<h2><a href="#">Privacy</a></h2>

								<h3>Updated August 3, 2015</h3>
								<p>
									
								</p>

<p>Sleek-geek, Inc., developer of Yooply values privacy. Yooply (“Yooply,” “we,” or “us”) understands that privacy is tremendously 
important to our online visitors to our website (“Website Visitors”), to schools who register for our Service (“Schools”), and to 
students whose information we may access on behalf of a School (“Students”). Yooply, and it’s parent company, sleek-geek, inc., provides
 a platform that enables Schools to securely sync, manage, create, enter, delete, and view information about students’ behavior, either
  positive, negative, or neutral, based on the determinations of the Schools. This privacy policy applies to our website 
  <a href="https://yoop.ly">https://yoop.ly</a> and to the Yooply platform (our “Service”) and describes the steps we take to protect 
  your data.</p>
  <p><strong>Note: Yooply has explicity adapted this Privacy Policy to reflect full compliance with FERPA, COPPA, and California AB 1584.</strong> <p>

<h4>1. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h4>

<p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

<p><strong>Information about Schools:</strong> We ask for certain information when a School administrator registers a School with Yooply, or if the 
administrator corresponds with us online, including a name, school name, school district, school email address and/or account name 
and password, phone number, message content, and information relating to the School’s information systems. We may also retain 
information provided by a School if the School sends us a message, posts content to our website or through our Service, or responds 
to emails or surveys. Once a School begins using the Yooply Service, we will keep records of activities related to the Service. 
We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze our Service 
offerings and functionality, and to communicate with our Schools and website visitors.</p>
<p> Depending on your school's customizations of Yooply, we may also collect other data about students
 and teachers (i.e. demographics including ethnicity, age, gender, etc) to provide custom reports based on these demographics. This data 
 is only accessible by persons who have been granted such access by the school. We also track server requests to prevent abuse, help in 
 support cases, and maintain a quality of service.</p>


 <p><strong>Student Data:</strong> Yooply may have access to personally identifiable information about students (“Student Data”) in the course of providing its 
 services to a School. We consider Student Data to be confidential and do not use such data for any purpose other than to provide the services 
 on the School’s behalf. In many instances, Yooply receives Student Data only from the School and never interacts with the Student directly. In 
 some instances, depending on the level of Yooply’s Service selected by the School, the Schools may allow Students to log into the Yooply Service 
 to access features of our Service that have been authorized by the School. In that instance, the School provides each student with login 
 credentials and confirms that it has obtained appropriate parental consents, as needed, before the student is permitted to access the Service.</p>

 <p>Yooply has access to Student Data only as requested by the School and only for the purposes of performing Services on the School’s behalf. If you 
 are a Student or parent, please contact your School if you have questions about the School’s use of technology service providers like Yooply.</p>

 <p>California AB 1584 Compliance: The pupil records the school districts or schools provide Yooply for the purposes of performing Services on 
 the School's behalf will remain the property and be under the control of the school district. A Student may request transfer of their own pupil-generated 
 content, such as personal reflections or  notes they have entered in School-created forms, to their own personal accounts,  in order to obtain control and 
 ownership, by <a href="https://yoop.ly/contact" > contacting us here. </a></p>

 <p>If a Student contacts Yooply with a question about our Service, we will collect personal information from that Student only as necessary to respond 
 to the Student’s request and direct the Student to contact the Student’s School, and we will then delete or anonymize the personal data of the Student 
 after providing our response.</p>

 <p>See <strong>How We Share Your Information</strong> below for more information on the limited ways in which we share School and Student Data. 
 See <strong>"Children’s Privacy"</strong> below for more information on how we collect and use the personal information of children under 13.
</p>

<p><strong>Information collected through technology:</strong> We automatically collect certain types of usage information when visitors view our 
website or use our service. We may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer 
that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Yooply help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey
 information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and 
 allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. We may collect log file information from your browser or mobile device each time you access
  the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, 
  information about your mobile device, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, pages viewed, and other such information. 
  The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party 
  analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These third-party analytics do not collect direct information, 
  such as name, address, telephone, email, password or username information about any user. We do not allow third party advertising networks to 
  collect information about the users of our Site or Service. </p>

  <p>We use or may use the data collected through cookies, log files, device identifiers to: (a) remember information so that a user will not have 
  to re-enter it during subsequent visits; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of
   our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and usage on our website and our Service; (e) diagnose or 
   fix technology problems; and (f) help users efficiently access information after signing in.</p>



   <h4>2. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
<p>Yooply only shares personal information in a few limited circumstances, described below. We do not rent or sell information for 
marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We only share your name and activity when you interact with other users on our service. For example, a student's name will be visible 
to teachers who are linked to their students and vice versa. Teachers and admins may be granted access to records such as detentions, referrals,
 rewards, etc., depending on how your school has been configured to use Yooply.</p>

<p>Who we may share information with:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may share information with those that provide us with technology services (e.g. web hosting and analytics services, student information 
systems), but strictly for the purpose of carrying out their work for us, such as storing the bits of data, and syncing user information for
 facilitating signing in to our service. </li> 
<li>We may be required to share information with law enforcement or other third parties when compelled to do so by court order or other legal 
process, to comply with statutes or regulations, to enforce our Terms of Use, or if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary 
to protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In the event of a change of control:</strong> If we sell, divest or transfer our business, we will not transfer personal information of our customers 
unless the new owner intends to maintain and provide the Service as a going concern, and provided that the new owner has agreed to data privacy 
standards no less stringent than our own. In such case we will provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of personally
 identifiable Student Data.</p>

<p><strong>How Student Data is shared:</strong> In addition to the actions described above, Yooply may facilitate the sharing of Student Data with third parties, 
though only when instructed and authorized to do so on behalf of the School. Some elements of our Service enable Schools to interact with parents,
 students, teachers and third party applications, for the benefit of the student’s education. Yooply does not facilitate the sharing of any Student
  Data with third parties on the Service except on behalf of the School after the School has authorized a third party or application to access 
  Student Data through the Service. Please remember that this Privacy Policy applies to the Yooply Services, and not other services or third party 
  applications, which may have their own privacy policies. Schools should carefully read the privacy practices of each third party application 
  before agreeing to engage with the application through the Service.</p>

<h4>3. HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

<p><strong>Storage and processing:</strong>Any information collected through the Service is stored and processed in the United States. If you use our Service 
outside of the United States, you consent to have your data transferred to the United States.
</p>

<p><strong>Keeping information safe:</strong> Yooply maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which 
are located in the United States. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and two factor authentication) to those 
employees who require it to perform their job functions. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard 
the account registration process and sign-up information. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, 
and physical access controls to building and files.</p>

<h4>4. YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

<p>Account information and settings: Schools may update account information and modify Services by signing into the administrator account.
 Schools and other website visitors can opt-out of receiving promotional email from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” feature at the bottom 
 of each email. Sorry, you cannot unsubscribe from Service-related messaging.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying account information, <a href="/contact">contact us here</a></p>

<p>Access to Student Data: Student Data is provided and controlled by the Schools. If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting personal information of a student, please contact your School directly.</p>

<p>Deleting or disabling cookies: You may be able to disallow cookies to be set on your browser. Please look for instructions on how to delete or disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools on your browser’s technical settings. You may not be able to delete or disable cookies on certain mobile devices and/or certain browsers. For more information on cookies, visit <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org.</a> Remember, disabling cookies may disable many of the features available on the Service, so we recommend you leave cookies enabled.</p>

<p>How long we keep User Content: Following termination or deactivation of a School account, Yooply may retain profile information and content 
for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes, but any and all Student Data associated with the School will be 
deleted promptly. We may maintain anonymized or aggregated data, including usage data, for analytics purposes. If you have any questions about
 data retention or deletion, please email <strong>contact@sleek-geek.net.</strong> <a href="/contact">contact us here</a></p>



<h4>5. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h4>
<p>Yooply does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 unless the School has obtained appropriate parental consent for the student to use the Service. 
Please reach us immediately at <strong>contact@sleek-geek.net </strong> if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child under
 13 without proper parental consents so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.</p>



<h4>Users 13 years old or younger</h4>

<p>Children 13 years old or younger are required to obtain parental/teacher permission to sign up to use Yoop.ly. We recommend parents supervise their 
children while they use the Internet, not just our services. If we are either notified or believe a user has not obtained the permission from an adult 
(teacher, parent, etc.), we reserve the right to terminate any accounts immediately without notification</p>



<h4>6. LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES</h4>
<p>Please remember that this privacy policy applies to the Yooply Services and Yooply website, and not other websites or third party applications,
 which may have their own Privacy Policies. You should carefully read the privacy practices of each third party application before agreeing to 
 engage with the application through the Service.</p>

<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites, applications or services linked to or from our Service. We recommend that the School 
review the privacy policies of other applications before authorizing a third party to access data through the Service.</p>

<h4>7. HOW TO CONTACT US</h4>
<p>Should you have any questions or concerns, please <a href="/contact">contact us here</a>. We know how it feels to be a user of a service 
and want to make sure your information is never misused.</p>
<h4>8. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
<p>Yooply may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time so you should review this page periodically. When we change the policy 
in a material manner we will let you know and update the ‘last modified’ date at the top of this page.</p>
<p>Yooply may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time so you should review this page periodically. If we change the policy 
in a material manner, for example if we seek to use personal information in a materially different way than we had previously, we will provide 
at least 30 days notice to the Schools so that you have sufficient time to evaluate the change in practice. Of course, you can always opt-out 
by deleting your account before the changes take effect.</p>


<h4>Marketing</h4>

<p>From time to time we may send you emails letting you know what's happening with Yooply. We are actively developing new features and want 
to make sure you are up to date and make the best use of our service. You may choose to unsubscribe from these updates by clicking on the 
link at the bottom of these emails or by <a href="/contact">contacting support</a> and letting us know your preference. If you unsubscribe 
from these emails, you will still receive service messages with updates when other users you are linked to perform certain actions.</p>
