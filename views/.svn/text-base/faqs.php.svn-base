									<span class="byline">
										What can it do for my school that I'm not already doing.
									</span>
								</header>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Is there an app I have to download?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>There are no app downloads in Yooply. At least not now. Everything works from your browser. On a smartphone you can fake
									it and make people think you have an app. Just create a button on your phone's home screen like you would on any website. </p>
								</section>


								 <section>
									<header>
										<h3>How do notifications work? Can I turn them off?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>When a teacher or admin assigns an incident, like a referral, detention, intervention, or any custom incident the school has created, the
									person making it can set any member of the school as recipient of the notification. They will see this in the notifications panel on the header bar.</p>
									<p>Notifications are useful when combined with a note or consequence, because it lets everyone that is notified know that there are follow-throughs and 
									things to keep track of, like making a phone call home, or setting up a restorative justice circle. It's all about closing the communication gaps and keeping
									everyone on the same page. 

									<p>To turn them off for yourself, see the settings page of your own account. </p>
									</section>
								<section>
									<header>
									 <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>In our dreams Yooply is free and everybody is happy. But in reality, we have some bills that hopefully Yooply will pay. 
									We promise to keep it affordable, more so than your other options. $2 per student per year is what we are asking. 
									If you have another proposal that would cost less (or more!) let us know.  </p>
									</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Our school doesn't do detentions, do we have to now start if we want to use Yooply?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We're happy when schools have no need to detain children against their will. But no, detentions, like all other 
										features that come built in to Yooply, are completely optional. You won't see them in your menus and your users won't 
										even know they exist for other, less fortunate schools. 
									</p>
									
								</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Our district already has a complicated office referral form on paper they want us to use. Can we still use Yooply?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Most likely, yes. You can modify our own referral form, or craft your own form completely from scratch to automate the
									process of filling it out. For example the person who submits the referral, the time, the location, can all be automatically
									entered by the app, and a list of pre-selected reasons can be easily accessed through dropdown menus. You can also
									add checkboxes you want teachers to use before they submit the referral, and add people who should also be notified.</p>
								</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Can the teachers assign rewards and demerits to other people's students as well?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>To have access to all the rosters in the school a teacher needs to have their account settings changed to a Teacher-Admin. 
									Only Admins can change this status.</p>
								</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>What are shout-outs? Are they a bad thing?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We introduced shout-outs into the student account to help them motivate each other with positive messages. Students can 
									send one to one or many of their friends to express gratitude, to cheer someone on, etc. You can customize what they can say
									to each other, but they can't edit the messages themselves. Future versions of Yooply might allow some students to 'earn' the right
									to author their own shout-outs.</p>
								</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>What is the benefit of using the Quick Entry mode?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Quick entry is used to easily look at one class and assign detentions, positive reinforcements and more, to one or many students. 
								    First tap the student or students that will receive the same consequence, or award, then select what they will all receive, and adjust
								    time, amount, etc.  </p>
								</section>




								<section>

										<h3>Our school does PBIS. Does it work with that?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Absolutely. Yooply is designed to be redesigned by its users. Our standard referral form, and other features were
									 inspired by PBIS. If you need something else, or more particular than what we offer out of the box, create your own custom
									 form and ask students, teachers and admins whatever you need.  </p>
								</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Our school uses Classroom bucks. Can Yooply let us use them?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Of course. Internally, or when you are setting them up in settings they are called 'awards', but you can call them
									anything you want, 'Scholar Dollars', 'Learner Credits', 'Awsome points', 'Merits', or whatever your school needs. All the
									stakeholders will see the name you choose. </p>
								</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>What can students do with the 'Bucks' they earn?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Students love earning 'cash' awards. But they hate losing them or having them stolen from their desks. With Yooply 
									students manage their awards themselves electronically. It is up to the teacher or school to set up a 'store' or 
									to provide incentives they could buy. We just provide the interface for this to happen. </p>
								</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Does your system integrate with my Student Information System?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We can onboard your SIS on a per-school basis using CSV files. We have our own bots
									to make it easy. Students can log on using Google Apps for Education accounts. </p>
									</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Does rewarding kids with points or "cash" just make them into some wicked version of Pavlov's dogs?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>In a perfect world all students would be intrinsically motivated to get along and try their best. For those that
									need something that will let teachers keep teaching and students invested, we recommend our positive
									reinforcement features. They won't work for everyone, and they are no substitution for real metacognitive growth and 
									mindfulness, but they will help you manage your class. </p>
									<p>If you find rewards like points, stars or 'scholar cash' abhorrent, then we recommend you don't use them, or rename them with 
									something that makes sesnse to you. </p>

									</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Are you integrated with Clever?</h3>
									</header>

									<p>We are setting up automated integration through 
									partners like <a href="http://clever.com">Clever</a>, which can give your school fast, easy and secure sign-on capabilites. Stay tuned!  </p>
								</section>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Is my child's discipline data now for sale? Or worse, be used against him when he tries to apply for Stanford?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Yooply is not in the business of selling student data, or data about data. Student information is shared only within the school 
									account, and even there only with people with the right access. All information and data is securely encrypted and not shared with other companies, 
									entities, or individuals. </p>
									<p>As long as your school handles the data ethically and responsibly, nobody outside the school will ever know that your little angels are not so angelic.
									</p>

									

									 
									 </section>


									 <section>
									<header>
										<h3>What about bullies?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We made it easy for students to report bullies. You can set the reasons or bullying behaviors in the settings panel of the Admin account.
									Bully reports are anonymous, so it is recommended that a school carry out its own investigation before taking action based on the information gathered through this form. </p>
